📘 EBHAM Network Project
Overview

This project documents the complete design, configuration, and security implementation of a network topology built during NTI training. The work focuses on subnetting, routing (OSPF), DHCP, ACLs, AAA authentication, firewall policies, NTP/Syslog integration, and Layer 2 security. The project demonstrates both fundamental networking principles and advanced security practices, ensuring robust connectivity and protection across devices.

🎯 Project Objectives

Implement an enterprise-scale network using Cisco routers and switches.

Apply subnetting strategies to optimize IP utilization.

Configure dynamic IP allocation via DHCP.

Deploy OSPF for efficient dynamic routing.

Secure the network with ACLs, AAA authentication, and encrypted routing updates.

Enforce Layer 2 security (STP, Portfast, BPDU Guard).

Set up Syslog and NTP for monitoring and synchronization.

Configure a Zone-Based Firewall for traffic inspection.

🌐 Network Design

Topology: Multi-router and multi-switch setup with end devices, servers, and VLANs.

Routing Protocol: OSPF with SHA authentication.

Security Enhancements: ACLs, ZPF, AAA, encrypted passwords.

Services: DHCP, NTP, Syslog, SSH access.

📊 Subnetting & Addressing

The network uses VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) for efficient allocation.

Large subnets (/28) for LANs.

Point-to-point links using /30 subnets.

Address table ensures clear IP ranges, broadcast IDs, and host counts.

(See full addressing table in the documentation for details.)

⚙️ Configuration Details
🔧 Router & Switch Setup

Hostnames, enable/console/vty passwords.

Password encryption & minimum length enforcement.

Logging synchronous for smoother CLI usage.

📡 DHCP Deployment

Routers configured with DHCP pools for automatic host assignment.

Static IP assignments for servers, DNS, and key devices.

📍 OSPF Routing

Enabled across all routers.

Passive interfaces for end-device connections.

SHA authentication applied to secure OSPF updates.

🔒 Security Features

ACLs: Restrict traffic to specific hosts and services.

AAA Authentication: Integrated with local and TACACS+/RADIUS methods.

Views: Role-based CLI command restrictions.

Zone-Based Firewall (ZPF): Allows only HTTPS and ICMP between zones, dropping other traffic.

🔐 Layer 2 Security

VLAN segmentation (VLAN 10 & VLAN 20).

Trunk connections between switches and router.

STP enhancements with Portfast and BPDU Guard.

⏱️ NTP & Syslog

NTP hierarchy configured from servers to routers and switches.

Syslog server deployed to collect device logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.

🧪 Testing & Verification

Ping & connectivity tests between PCs across VLANs and routers.

SSH access validated with ACL restrictions.

Firewall inspection tested with HTTPS and ICMP sessions.

Syslog and NTP successfully synchronized across devices.

üìò EBHAM Network Project
‚óè	Overview
This project documents the complete design, configuration, and security implementation of a network topology built during NTI training. The work focuses on subnetting, routing (OSPF), DHCP, ACLs, AAA authentication, firewall policies, NTP/Syslog integration, and Layer 2 security. The project demonstrates both fundamental networking principles and advanced security practices, ensuring robust connectivity and protection across devices.

üéØ Project Objectives
‚Ä¢	Implement an enterprise-scale network using Cisco routers and switches.
‚Ä¢	Apply subnetting strategies to optimize IP utilization.
‚Ä¢	Configure dynamic IP allocation via DHCP.
‚Ä¢	Deploy OSPF for efficient dynamic routing.
‚Ä¢	Secure the network with ACLs, AAA authentication, and encrypted routing updates.
‚Ä¢	Enforce Layer 2 security (STP, Portfast, BPDU Guard).
‚Ä¢	Set up Syslog and NTP for monitoring and synchronization.
‚Ä¢	Configure a Zone-Based Firewall for traffic inspection.

üåê Network Design
‚Ä¢	Topology: Multi-router and multi-switch setup with end devices, servers, and VLANs.
‚Ä¢	Routing Protocol: OSPF with SHA authentication.
‚Ä¢	Security Enhancements: ACLs, ZPF, AAA, encrypted passwords.
‚Ä¢	Services: DHCP, NTP, Syslog, SSH access.
________________________________________
üìä Subnetting & Addressing
The network uses VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) for efficient allocation.
‚Ä¢	Large subnets (/28) for LANs.
‚Ä¢	Point-to-point links using /30 subnets.
‚Ä¢	Address table ensures clear IP ranges, broadcast IDs, and host counts.
(See full addressing table in the documentation for details.)

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details
üîß Router & Switch Setup
‚Ä¢	Hostnames, enable/console/vty passwords.
‚Ä¢	Password encryption & minimum length enforcement.
‚Ä¢	Logging synchronous for smoother CLI usage.
üì° DHCP Deployment
‚Ä¢	Routers configured with DHCP pools for automatic host assignment.
‚Ä¢	Static IP assignments for servers, DNS, and key devices.
üìç OSPF Routing
‚Ä¢	Enabled across all routers.
‚Ä¢	Passive interfaces for end-device connections.
‚Ä¢	SHA authentication applied to secure OSPF updates.
üîí Security Features
‚Ä¢	ACLs: Restrict traffic to specific hosts and services.
‚Ä¢	AAA Authentication: Integrated with local and TACACS+/RADIUS methods.
‚Ä¢	Views: Role-based CLI command restrictions.
‚Ä¢	Zone-Based Firewall (ZPF): Allows only HTTPS and ICMP between zones, dropping other traffic.
